# CoDDeclassifiedImporter
A python-based blender importer for CoD Declassified .smf models
The importer works for about 98% of samples. It extracts all data, so there are 3 different lod models side by side for mostly humanoid models. Within each model there are repeated meshes of differing lod so you WILL need to hide some or delete some to get the highest fidelity mesh. (eg if you import menendez and his face is covered with a low poly mesh, delete some of them covering it and you will find the higher detailed mesh beneath)
